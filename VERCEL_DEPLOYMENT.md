# PTEX Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ Important Notice: Vercel Compatibility Issue

After investigation, **Vercel is not the ideal platform for this full-stack Ruby on Rails application**.

Vercel is optimized for:
- Static sites
- Serverless functions
- Headless/API-only applications

Your PTEX application is a full-stack Rails app with:
- Database connections
- Session management
- Server-side rendering
- Background jobs

## ✅ Recommended Hosting Platforms

### 1. Railway (Recommended)
- **Free tier available**
- Excellent Rails support
- Easy database setup
- Simple deployment process
- Website: https://railway.app

### 2. Render
- **Free tier available**
- Great Rails support
- Built-in PostgreSQL
- Automatic deployments
- Website: https://render.com

### 3. Fly.io
- **Free tier available**
- Modern deployment platform
- Docker-based deployments
- Global edge deployment
- Website: https://fly.io

### 4. Heroku
- **Most Rails-friendly** (industry standard)
- Paid plans only (no free tier)
- Extensive add-on ecosystem
- Website: https://heroku.com

## Quick Migration Guide

### Option 1: Railway (Easiest)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### Option 2: Render
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Choose "Web Service"
3. Set build command: `bundle install && rails assets:precompile`
4. Set start command: `bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb`
5. Add environment variables (DATABASE_URL will be auto-provided)

### Option 3: Fly.io
```bash
# Install Fly CLI
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Deploy
fly launch
fly deploy
```

## Current Vercel Status

The current Vercel deployment shows a static information page explaining the platform compatibility issue. The Rails application code remains intact and ready for deployment to a compatible platform.

## Files Added for Vercel Attempt

- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration (now simplified to static)
- `public/index.html` - Static information page
- `app/controllers/status_controller.rb` - Status monitoring (useful for any platform)
- `app/views/status/` - Status pages (useful for any platform)
- Error handling improvements (beneficial for any deployment)

These additions won't interfere with deployment to other platforms and some (like status monitoring) will be beneficial regardless of hosting choice.
